Reproducibility
	The following series of scripts can be used to reproduce the results/figures/
	tables given in the paper.
	
	A) Download scripts 
		- xd-elg-download.sh:
			Describes where and how all the relevant files can be obtained from the web.
			For certain files, "wget <url>" commands are provided for convenience.
			Download all the files before using "reproducibility" section below.

		- DR3-DEEP2f**-tractor-download.sh:
			Used to download tractor files as described in xd-elg-download.sh script.


	B) Scripts for preparing and combining DEEP2 and DECaLS DR3 data:
		- produce-deep2-f234-photo-redz-oii.py:
			Combine extended DEEP2 pcat catalogs, impose badflag==0 and window function masks, append
			colummns from redshift catalogs, DEEP2 color-selection catalogs, and selection probability
			catalogs. For each remaining DEEP2 object, compute class number.

		- produce-DECaLS-DR3-Tractor-DEEP2f234.py:
			Show how DR3-DEEP2f**-tractor-download.sh scripts were generated using DECaLS DR3 bircks
			file. Combine all relevant Tractor files and mask objects that do not have positive flux
			invariance and brickprimary !=0. Append Tycho-2 stellar mask column and impose DEEP2
			window functions.

		- produce-DECaLS-DR3-DEEP2-f234.py:
			Load processed DEEP2 and DECaLS catalogs. Apply Tycho-2 stellar masks to DECaLS objects
			impose flux positivity condition. Cross-match the two catalogs within respective field.
			After accounting for astrometric differences (in median), append select information from 
			DEEP2 to DECaLS catalogs. Save the whole DECaLS catalog with an additional column indicating
			whether the object was found in DEEP2 or not. Lastly, estimate and save the area of 
			intersection of the two survey based on point Monte Carlo method.

		Note 1: These scripts should be ran sequentially.


	C) Scripts for training obtaining XD selection model parameters
		- fit-dNdm-glim24.py:
			Load the intersection set data, set basic parameters for fitting, and fit power law or
			broken power law to number density distribution in g-magnitude.

		- fit-GMM-glim24.py:
			



	D) Scripts for figures and tables for the paper
		- plot-classes.py: Used to plot various classes whose definitions are given
			in the paper.
